# Web-APIs-Code-Quiz

## Description

My motivation was to create a questionaire in a format of a multiple-choice quiz. I built this project so individuals could learn code-related topics and compete for the best time. This problem solves learning in an ordinary way. I learned how to use logic to meet the criteria associated with generating a set of questions, answers, and rankings.
